## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to aply tailwind in this project and I modified repository's structure to implement this framework, using Vite and MPA.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me for styling purposes.
- [Vite Multi-Page App](https://vite.dev/guide/build.html#multi-page-app) - This is an amazing info which helped me finally understand the differences between MAP and SPA when you're trying to implement it in your project folder.
